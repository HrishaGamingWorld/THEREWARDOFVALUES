'THE REWARD OF VALUES'
ONCE THERE LIVED A GIRL NAMED LARA AND HER MOTHER IN A SMALL VILLAGE. THEY LIVED IN A SMALL AND BROKEN 
COTTAGE. THEY WERE FINANCIALLY POOR BUT RICH FROM HEART. LARA'S MOTHER ALWAYS ENCOURAGED LARA TO HELP 
OTHERS AND ENGAGE HERSELF IN SOCIAL WORKS. ONE BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING LARA WENT FOR FISHING WHERE SHE SAT 
FOR 1 HOUR BUT DID NOT FIND ANY FISH. HOWEVER SHE DID NOT GIVE UP AND WAITED THERE WITH PATIENCE. 
ENAMOURED OF HER PATIENCE THE QUEEN OF THE LAKE ROSE FROM THE LAKE AND APPRIECIATED HER PATIENCE AND MORAL 
MANNERS. SHE GIFTED HER A GOLDEN FISH INSIDE A POND WHICH WAS REWARD FOR HER PATIENCE AND HELPING NATURE.
LARA WENT HOME AND COMPREHENDED EVERYTHING TO HER MOTHER. HER MOTHER WAS PROUD OF HER AND GAVE HER A WARM HUG.
THE GOLDEN FISH WAS LIKE A LUCKY CHARM AND BROUGHT PROSPERITY IN THEIR LIFE, FINANCIALLY.
